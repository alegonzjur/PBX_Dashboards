## Conclusions 

It's a good dataset to start in data analysis thanks to all the different features that it has and it's easy understanding of the concept. Some conclusions that i've taken from the dashboard are that average price doesn't vary greatly according to the different values of certain variables, such as bathroom number, bedroom number, property type, state... The SQFT Price is almost similar in every city, and construction year does not follow a pattern in the final price. It's difficult to extract key information, but for getting started into data anaylsis, it is an acceptable dataset.
