## Conclusions

This kind of datasets need more administrative or stock experience to take away significant findings. You can see clearly in charts how much the company has grown, and it's ups and downs, which can be related to actions taken by the company, such as shared accounts block, or worldwide moments, like COVID lockdown. The dataset is focused on the stock value, therefore there aren't much conclusions to rescue.
