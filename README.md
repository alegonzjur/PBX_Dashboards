# PBX_Dashboards

Uploading personal PowerBI dashboards. These dashboards are made to improve my PowerBI abilities and analytical skills.

Each dashboard created is located in its own directory with its README file which describes every aspect of the dashboard. Most of the datasets are from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

The actual structure of each dashboard directory is:

- --- **Dashboard Directory**
	- ----- **data** (Data source)
		- ----- *file.csv* (CSV File which contains the information.)
	 - ----- **images** (Images used/about the dashboard)
		 - ----- *d1.png* (Dashboard Images.)
		 - ----- *logo.png* (Possible logos for decoration.)
	 - ----- **themes** (PowerBI themes to decorate the dashboard.)
		 - ----- *file.json* (JSON File to import on PowerBI.)
	 - ----- *dashboard_name.pbix* (PowerBI Dashboard File.)
	 - ----- *README.md* (Dashboard description/conclusions.)
